sk_power_monitor

Introduction
------------

`sk_power_monitor` is a simple power monitor for Raspberry Pi. It 
monitors a defined GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi. If the pin goes
low for five seconds, a shutdown is triggered.

The main use case for the script is to have the board powered via
a couple of super-capacitors. In the case power for the board is
disconnected, the supercaps are able to supply sufficient power
that the device is able to shut itself down in a controlled fashion.
